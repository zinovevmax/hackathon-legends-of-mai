Here are 10 facts about airplanes:
Airplanes are incredibly safe. Despite what movies might make you think, flying is one of the safest modes of transportation.
The first commercial flight carried only four passengers. In 1919, a flight between Paris and London marked the beginning of commercial aviation.
 The Boeing 747 can hold over 1,000 people. During a refugee evacuation, a Boeing 747 once carried a record-breaking number of passengers.
 Airplane doors can't be opened in flight. Safety features prevent doors from being opened while the plane is in the air.
Every plane has an oxygen supply for passengers. In case of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, oxygen masks will automatically deploy.
A plane's weight changes during flight. Due to the burning of fuel, a plane becomes lighter as it travels.
The English language is used for international air traffic control. Pilots and air traffic controllers around the world communicate in English.
There are more than 30,000 flights in the US every day. Air travel is a major part of daily life in many countries.
The world's busiest airport is in Atlanta. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport handles millions of passengers each year.
Only a small percentage of the world's population has ever flown on a plane. Air travel is still a luxury for many people.
Airplane Structure: A General Overview and Detailed Breakdown
An airplane is a complex engineering structure designed for flight in the atmosphere. Its structure consists of many interconnected components, each of which performs a specific function.
General structure of an airplane
In the most general terms, an airplane can be represented as consisting of the following main parts:
Fuselage: This is the central body of the aircraft, which houses passengers, cargo, fuel, crew, and equipment. The fuselage provides structural strength and aerodynamic characteristics for the aircraft.
Wing: The main lifting surface of the aircraft, creating lift due to the difference in air pressure above and below the wing.
Empennage: Consists of the stabilizer and rudder. The stabilizer provides longitudinal stability for the aircraft, and the rudder allows you to change course.
Landing gear: Supports the aircraft on the ground, used for takeoff and landing.
Engine: Converts fuel energy into thrust, which is necessary for aircraft movement.
Detailed breakdown of aircraft components
Fuselage
Nose section: It usually houses the cockpit, radar equipment, and other flight control systems.
Center section: In passenger aircraft, passenger cabins are located here, and in cargo aircraft, cargo compartments.
Tail section: The empennage, auxiliary power units, and other systems are located here.
Wing
Wing profile: Determines the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing.
Wing mechanization: A set of movable wing elements (flaps, slats, spoilers) that allow changing the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing during flight.
Wing fuel tanks: Store fuel for engines.
Empennage
Stabilizer: A horizontal surface that provides longitudinal stability for the aircraft.
Rudder: A vertical surface that allows you to change the course of the aircraft.
Fin: A fixed part of the empennage to which the rudder is attached.
Landing gear
Main landing gear: Located under the fuselage and provides the main load-bearing capacity during landing.
Nose landing gear: Located under the nose of the aircraft and provides steering on the ground.
Landing gear retraction system: Allows you to retract the landing gear into special niches in the wing or fuselage during flight to reduce aerodynamic drag.
Engine
Turbojet engine: Used on most modern aircraft, converts the energy of fuel combustion into mechanical energy that rotates an air screw or turbine.
Propeller: Creates thrust by rotating blades.
Turbine: Creates thrust by accelerating the airflow.
