LangChain is a library for building applications based on language models (LLMs). The main modules are:
1. Chains — for sequential data processing.
2. Agents — allow LLMs to perform tasks.
3. Memory — stores the context of a conversation.

LangChain supports models like GPT-3, Alpaca, and integration with external tools.
