Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating algorithms capable of learning from data. The main types of machine learning are:
1. Supervised Learning — data includes inputs and corresponding outputs.
2. Unsupervised Learning — data lacks labels, and the model finds hidden patterns.
3. Reinforcement Learning — the model learns through interaction with the environment.
